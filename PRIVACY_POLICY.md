- **Game State Synchronization**: Game state information is synchronized between players in real-time to ensure all players see the same game board and progress.

- **Game History**: Game data is stored temporarily during active game sessions and is automatically deleted when games end or are abandoned.

### Data Storage

- **Firebase Services**: We use Google Firebase (Firestore) to store game data temporarily. This data includes:
  - Game room information
  - Player statistics
  - Board state
  - Turn information

- **Local Storage**: Some game preferences and settings may be stored locally on your device.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **No Other Third Parties**: We do not sell, trade, or share your information with any other third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## Data Retention

- **Active Games**: Game data is retained only while a game is active. Once a game ends or is abandoned, the data is automatically deleted.
